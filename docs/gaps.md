# Known gaps vs. requirements / v1 design

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

Found while syncing docs to the actual implementation (2025-10-06) — not yet triaged as intentionally
dropped vs. still planned:

1. `ORDER_RECORD` has no `idempotency_key` — the idempotent-order-creation requirement isn't backed yet.
2. `API_KEY` has no `webhook_secret_hash`.
3. `CUSTOMER` has no `gst_id`.
4. `PAYMENT` has no running `refunded_amount` total (derivable from `REFUND` rows instead).
5. `PAYMENT_TRANSITION_LOG` has no `reason` field.
6. **Secrets are stored unhashed in three places** — `AuthServiceImpl.signup` writes
   `request.password()` straight into `AppUser.passwordHash`, and both
   `ApiKeyServiceImpl.create`/`.rotate` write the raw generated secret straight into
   `ApiKey.keySecretHash`/`previousKeySecretHash`. None of it is hashed. Flagged, not fixed yet;
   commit and push proceeded as-is at the user's explicit call (2025-10-10 for the password,
   2025-10-14/26 for the API key secret), pending one shared hashing-dependency decision
   (`spring-security-crypto` vs. full `spring-boot-starter-security`) to fix all of it together.
7. **`POST /v1/orders` uses a hardcoded `merchantId`** — `OrderController` has a fixed test UUID as
   an instance field instead of deriving the merchant from any caller identity, since there's no
   auth yet. Every order created through this endpoint currently belongs to the same merchant.
